title: About .Net Liverpool
---
Dot Net Liverpool's is intended to for any novice, intermediate or professional developer interesting in Microsoftâ€™s technology stack. So join us for our open free talks around Liverpool. Our sponsors help provide food, drinks and a venue to cater for crowds of up to 40 technologists to meet up in a friendly environment.

Our community group was founded by Joshua Duxbury, a software developer currently working for The Lead Agency in Liverpool and a bunch of local volunteers. 

We typically try to run on the last Thursday of every month!
