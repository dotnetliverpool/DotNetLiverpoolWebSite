title: About .Net Liverpool
---
Dot Net Liverpool is a meet up group intended for any developers with an interest in Microsoft's technology stack. So join us for our open free talks around Liverpool. Our sponsors help provide food, drinks and a venue to cater for crowds of up to 40 technologists to meet up in a friendly environment.

Our community group was founded by Joshua Duxbury, a software developer currently working for The Lead Agency in Liverpool and a bunch of local volunteers. 

We typically try to run on the last Thursday of every month for more information on upcoming events please visit our meetup page
