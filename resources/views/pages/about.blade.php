        </header>

        <p>Dot Net Liverpool is a meet up group intended for any developers with an interest in Microsoftâ€™s technology
            stack. So join us for our open free talks around Liverpool. Our sponsors help provide food, drinks and a
            venue to cater for crowds of up to 40 technologists to meet up in a friendly environment.</p>

        <p>Our community group was founded by Joshua Duxbury, a software developer currently working for The Lead
            Agency in Liverpool and a bunch of local volunteers.</p>

        <p>We typically try to run on the last Thursday of every month for more information on upcoming events please
            visit our meetup page</p>
